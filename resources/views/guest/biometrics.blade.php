                        For the purposes of Canadian immigration, biometrics identification is the
                        collection of an applicant's fingerprints and photo for facial recognition.

                        It is important for Canada's immigration authorities to be able to identify anyone
                        applying to come to Canada as a visitor, student, worker, permanent resident,
                        refugee claimant, or asylum seeker. Biometric screening is used to protect the
                        safety and security of Canadians and ensure the integrity of Canada's immigration
                        system. The collection of biometrics identification (fingerprints and facial
                        recognition photos) is considered an efficient tool for correctly identifying
                        individuals. Biometrics collection enables the Government of Canada to facilitate
                        application processing and simplify entry into Canada for low-risk travellers.

                        Applicants will need to give their biometrics once every 10 years. Applicants donâ€™t

                        The Government of Canada applies an additional fee for biometrics screening and
                        processing, which depends on whether applicants are applying as individuals, with
                        family members, or as a group.

                        The Government of Canada says fingerprints are encrypted and sent electronically
                        through a secure internal system to the Canadian Immigration Biometrics
                        Identification System. Once the transfer is complete, personal information is
                        deleted from the database.
